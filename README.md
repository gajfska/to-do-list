# To Do List - Version using `mat-table` for Angular Material

This version of the application was implemented by using `mat-table` from Angular Material https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview .

This implementation is "simpler" and "optimal" one, as it uses optimization provided by an external library and prepared functionalities like data source and pagination. Yet, as it depends on external dependency, it constrains the number of possible modifications that can be applied. 

## Tech/framework used

- HTML
- Angular 9.1.3 
- CSS
- Material Design

## Installation
To run the project you first need to set up NPM and Angular CLI tool.

NPM you can get from https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
Angular CLI can be installed by calling:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

After downloading the repository you need to download all dependencies using NPM:
```sh
$ npm install
```
Next run `ng serve` to start the app locally. In the browsers of your selection navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Please remember that if you are running another app on the same port already, you need to choose a different one when starting a local server by calling `ng serve --port 4401` for example.
